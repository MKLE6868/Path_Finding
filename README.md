# Path_Finding
A python program that finds the best pathway to a specific location
Utilize module pygame, math and queue to visualize the program and implement the algorithm
Create a point system for distance between nodes by using graph theory
Utilize taxicab geometry to calculate the distance between the start and end points
Utilize heuristic function ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each node based on points to decide which pathway to follow
